# Store App

Store App is a comprehensive web application built using ASP.NET Core MVC. It demonstrates the implementation of key features and best practices in ASP.NET Core, including the MVC design pattern, CRUD operations, authentication and authorization, and database integration. The application is designed to be a practical learning project, showcasing a user-friendly interface with responsive design.

## Description

This project was initially created as part of BTK Akademi ASP.NET Core MVC course by Doç. Dr. Zafer CÖMERT. I have further enhanced it, with a primary focus on improving the user interface and overall user experience.

The application demonstrates:

- **MVC Design Pattern**: Separation of concerns using Models, Views, and Controllers.
- **CRUD Operations**: Full implementation of Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure login system with role-based access control (e.g., admin vs. user functionality).
- **Database Integration**: Uses Entity Framework Core to manage data with a SQL database.
- **Responsive Design**: User-friendly interface designed with Bootstrap to ensure compatibility across devices.
